## Future Goals

As this application develops going forward the future goals for the project are

### Global Leaderboards

With the user being presented with a score upon completion, ideally in the future as my skills increase, adding a leader board could help incetivise users to keep playing and trying to being their score or potentially beat a friend

### Challenge Mode

In future i would also like to add a challenge mode which would mix genres and test the user in an initial test of a chosen topic then on general knowledge which could also feed into a leaderboard system
