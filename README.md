## Aim of the site

The aim of The Quiz Hub is to provide a fun easy to use web based quiz game.
The game will allow the user to choose a genre of questions and the amount of questions they want to be tested on.

Each question will be presented individually to the user with 4 potential options to choose from.

## Future Goals

As this application develops going forward the future goals for the project are

### Global Leaderboards

With the user being presented with a score upon completion, ideally in the future as my skills increase, adding a leader board could help incetivise users to keep playing and trying to being their score or potentially beat a friend

### Challenge Mode

In future i would also like to add a challenge mode which would mix genres and test the user in an initial test of a chosen topic then on general knowledge which could also feed into a leaderboard system
