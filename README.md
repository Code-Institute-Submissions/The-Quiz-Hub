## UX (User Experience)

### Project Goals

The goal of this project is to create a simple and user friendly quiz game sourcing data from a trivia API to allow for a new constant feed of new questions across various categories whilst removing the requirement to program new questions to keep this up to date. This will give users a reason to come back and keep playing when they have completed the quiz.

### User goals

The main expected user is a broad field but expected to fall into one of the below criteria

1. A casual user
2. Someone wanting a quiz time waster with little to invest
3. Quiz enthusiast

With regards to other sites online, this site ideally needs to be

1. Easy to use
2. Be quick and easy to start and complete
3. Be able to restart and keep the user engaged consistently
4. Be updated with new content regularly 
5. Visually appealing but not too harsh on the eye


### User stories

1. As a user i want the site to be easy to use with a colourful and welcoming inferface.
2. As a user i want to be able to choose what questions i'm given
3. As a user i want to be able to select how hard the questions are so my kids could play it
4. As a user i want to be challenged!
5. As a user i want to come back and know i'm getting new questions not the same quiz over and over.

### Designer goals 

1. Create a simple but engaging quiz game
2. Minimise continued maintanence with externally sourced quiz questions
3. Be engaging enough to hold peoples attention to users coming back to the site after first use.

### Design Choices

#### Fonts

Due to the minimal approach to the design i decided to use a single font to allow the content to be consistent throughout, deciding on Solway provided through the google font service, i felt this offered the user a simple easy to read font allowing content to be easily read on all devices

#### Colours

After discussing various colour combinations with potential users of this site, i decided upon the following fonts allowing for a vibrant colour pallet with good contract ratios 


Background color: #2828fc 
Logo & Content: #e6a11c 3.38 contrast score with a black outline allows the content to stand out easily.
Text and social icons: #d3d3d3 5.01 contrast score over background
Text over answers: #000 a standard black text allows answers to be easily read.

## Features

As the primary feature of the site is to provide a quiz application to the user it will allow the below options to expand the users experiance to their tastes

### Select a topic

The user is presented with an option to choose a topic of choice from all available topics helping to provide a more tailored game to the user

### Select Difficulty

For younger users or for people wanting a lesser or harder challenge the user is given the option to select a difficulty of questions from either Easy, Medium or Hard

### Select Number Of Questions

As people may want a longer game or shorter game the user is presented with the option to select the amount of questions the app will provide them.

---

## Future Goals

As this application develops going forward the future goals for the project are

### Global Leaderboards

With the user being presented with a score upon completion, ideally in the future as my skills increase, adding a leader board could help incetivise users to keep playing and trying to being their score or potentially beat a friend

### Challenge Mode

In future i would also like to add a challenge mode which would mix genres and test the user in an initial test of a chosen topic then on general knowledge which could also feed into a leaderboard system
